# Workday-planner

As a student and a working adult, I tend to have a fairly busy schedule most days, as such, an easy to use planner is ESENTIAL to making sure I can keep track of everything I must do in a day.  That's why, over the last week, I've worked on making a small workday planner to help keep track of what I have to do during a day.

## Features of the site

```
-9 time blocks that you can put in tasks that need to be completed
-A save function on each of the time blocks that pushes the text into local storage and persists it's text through reloads
-A clock that shows the date and time to the second
-Reactive css features that changes the background color of the blocks depending on whether or not the time of day has gone past it
-A clear all button to remove everything from local storage if wanted
```
